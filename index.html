            <p>Since this dataset was pulled from <b><i>Kaggle</i></b> to much cleaning was not necessary. I trimmed few unnecessary data & added a few columns by using the existing data for analysis. I've also converted string data to <b><i>boolean</i></b> for the column called <b><i>Reached on time</i></b>. This column recorded if on time delivery was a success or not.</p>
